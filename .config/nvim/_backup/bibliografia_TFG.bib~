	abstract = {The inversion potential for the ammonia molecule is approximated by V (x) = k(x2 − r2)2/8r2. The Hamiltonian thereby contains only even powers of p and x and a representation in terms of ladder operators a and a† is suggested. The frequency variable ω occurring in the operators is introduced as a free parameter, with its value to be determined such as to optimize agreement with experimental results. Using known structural parameters of the ammonia molecule, the eigenvalues for a 10 × 10 truncation of the Hamiltonian matrix are computed. The splitting between the two lowest eigenvalues corresponds to the ammonia maser frequency, 24.87 {GHz}, this value being reproduced by the appropriate choice of ω.},

	abstract = {Quantum tunnelling is a phenomenon which becomes relevant at the nanoscale and below. It is a paradox from the classical point of view as it enables elementary particles and atoms to permeate an energetic barrier without the need for sufficient energy to overcome it. Tunnelling might seem to be an exotic process only important for special physical effects and applications such as the Tunnel Diode, Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (electron tunnelling) or Near-field Optical Microscopy operating in photon tunnelling mode. However, this review demonstrates that tunnelling can do far more, being of vital importance for life: physical and chemical processes which are crucial in theories about the origin and evolution of life can be traced directly back to the effects of quantum tunnelling. These processes include the chemical evolution in stellar interiors and within the cold interstellar medium, prebiotic chemistry in the atmosphere and subsurface of planetary bodies, planetary habitability via insolation and geothermal heat as well as the function of biomolecular nanomachines. This review shows that quantum tunnelling has many highly important implications to the field of molecular and biological evolution, prebiotic chemistry and astrobiology.},

Proton transfer mechanism is a critical phenomenon that is related to the acid–base characteristics of the nucleobases in Watson–Crick base pairs. The energetic and dynamical behavior of the proton can be depicted from these characteristics and their adjustment to the water molecules or the surrounding ions. Further, new pathways open up in which protonated nucleobases are generated by proton transfer from the ionized water molecules and elimination of a hydroxyl radical in this review, the analysis will be focused on understanding the mechanism of untargeted mutations in canonical, wobble, Hoogsteen pairs, and mutagenic tautomers through the non-covalent interactions. Further, rare tautomer formation through the single proton transfer ({SPT}) and the double proton transfer ({DPT}), quantum tunneling in nucleobases, radiation-induced bystander effects, role of water in proton transfer ({PT}) reactions, {PT} in anticancer drugs–{DNA} interaction, displacement and oriental polarization, possible models for mutations in {DNA}, genome instability, and role of proton transfer using kinetic parameters for {RNA} will be discussed.},

Students ﬁrst begin in the classical worldthe world within which they are most familiar, explore tunneling in the {NH}3 inversion paradigm to gain exposure to the stark diﬀerences between classical and quantum behavior, and ﬁnally extend the concept of tunneling to the nanoscale through the examination of spectroscopic results in the literature of {CdSe}/{ZnS} core/shell quantum dots. Additionally, the activity has been assessed via a mixed-methods approach using qualitative analysis of individual student interviews (pre- and postactivity) and recordings of students’ group discourse, along with small-sample statistical techniques when appropriate. Our ﬁndings suggest that students are able to successfully incorporate the language of quantum mechanical tunneling into their scientiﬁc language, and there is evidence for analogical transfer between relevant concepts within the activity.},

The potential to better “explore by yourself” the lecture material permits students to have an enhanced learning experience and stimulates them to tinker with equation parameters generating insightful ﬁgures or animations. Used in the classroom, it emboldens students to have a deeper comprehension of complex derivations or mathematical expressions. We illustrate the power of interactive learning platforms by presenting educational Jupyter notebooks for the study of a fundamental problem in quantum chemistry: the motion of a particle in 1D and 2D space. Although simple, this model oﬀers the possibility to explore several important quantum chemistry concepts such as Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, conﬁnement leading to quantization, tunneling eﬀect, and even bonding and antibonding properties. We present four Jupyter notebooks that gradually walk the student from the properties of a free particle to the properties of a particle in a double potential well. Our experience gained from the implementation of the material in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum is discussed, including student feedback and examples of complementary homework to be used in the classroom.},

	abstract = {Does Umbrella inversion motion of ammonia really correspond to a back-and-forth oscillation between its two equilibrium molecular structures,
              i.e.
              , dynamical localization over the two potential wells, as described by the textbook picture?
            
          , 
            
              Umbrella inversion of ammonia is a prototypical example of large-amplitude vibrational motion, described with a symmetric double-well potential. The transition state of the latter corresponds to a planar (
              D
              3h
              ) molecular geometry, whereas the two equilibrium configurations are equivalent (
              C
              3v
              ) pyramidal structures, with the nitrogen atom being either ‘above’ or ‘below’ the plane of the hydrogen atoms. As commonly understood, inversion motion of ammonia corresponds to the coherent, anharmonic, vibrational motion of the molecule, which shuttles back and forth between the two potential wells; that is, oscillation of the nitrogen atom from one side of the H
              3
              plane to the other,
              via
              coherent tunneling. However, this intuitively appealing view of umbrella inversion results from a reduced description of the dynamics, which includes only the inversion vibrational coordinate and fully neglects all the other molecular degrees of freedom. As such, this textbook picture of inversion motion ignores the fact that the two equilibrium structures of ammonia are superimposable, and can only be distinguished by labelling the identical hydrogen nuclei. A correct description of umbrella inversion, which incorporates nuclear permutations, requires the inclusion of other molecular modes. Indeed, it is well known that the quantum symmetrization postulate engenders entanglement between ammonia's nuclear-spin, inversion, and rotation. Using the explicit expressions of the corresponding zeroth-order eigenstates, we clearly show that the inversion density of any multilevel wavepacket of ammonia, including the case of perfectly aligned molecules, is symmetrically distributed between the two potential wells, at all times. This follows from a rigorous demonstration based on the evaluation of the expectation values of the inversion coordinate or equivalent projection operators. However, provided that these wavepackets involve inversion–rotation levels with opposite parity, the inversion density may exhibit dynamical spatial localization. In the latter case, the space-fixed inversion density or, equivalently, the expectation values of the projections of the inversion coordinate on the space-fixed axes, may oscillate between opposite directions in the space-fixed frame. Nevertheless, in all cases, localization of ammonia in a single potential well is impossible, even partially or transiently. This is equivalent to saying that the nitrogen atom has the same probability (one-half) to be on either side of the H
              3
              plane, for any wavepacket of the molecule and at all times—a conclusion which is in perfect accord with the principle of the indistinguishability of identical particles (nuclei).},
